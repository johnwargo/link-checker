# (Yet Another) Link Checker

A simple node.js-based command line utility that validates links on a web site. You provide the target URL and answer a couple of questions and the utility scans all links on the target site (recursively) and reports the results to the console. You can even write the results to a file in json, markdown and text format for further analysis.

## Installation


## Usage

## Background

I started with [Using Node.js to Check for Broken Links](https://www.seancdavis.com/posts/using-nodejs-to-check-for-broken-links/) then made it more flexible by accepting the site URL on the command line.
