# (Yet Another) Link Checker

A simple node.js-based terminal (command-line) utility that validates links on a local or remote web site. You provide the target URL and answer a couple of questions and the utility scans all links on the target site (recursively) and reports the results to the console. You can even write the results to a file in json, markdown and text format for further analysis.

## Installation

npm install -g @johnwargo/link-checker

With that in place, you can execute the utility from anywhere using:
